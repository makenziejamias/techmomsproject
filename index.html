		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> Hi, my name is Makenzie. 👋🏼 My career started out in design, photography, and events. </p> 
            
        <p> 
            I transfered those skills into digital marketing and took a marketing role at a local business and got my hands dirty in website maintenance, blog writing, organic social media, event photography, designing marketing materials, paid ads, and writing email newsletters. I realized I was really good at creating content (especially on social media) and wanted more flexibility, so I quit my 9-5 & started freelancing.
        </p>
        <p> 
            OWNING MY OWN AGENCY:
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2017, I got the business license for Jamias Creative, a social media & content marketing agency. Within a few short months, I picked up enough clients to replace my previous 9-5 job income. I was ecstatic! After only 8 months in business, my husband (who had previously been running the marketing for a startup) was able to join my business full-time as a co-owner.
        </p>
        <p>  
            In 6 short years, I was able to:
            <li>Generate $700,000+ in revenue</li>
            <li>Produce 70+ million organic social media impressions for businesses</li> 
            <li>Hire 15+ employees & contractors</li>
            <li>Photograph 600+ events, lifestyle, product, portraits, & weddings</li>
            <li>Coordinate 100+ influencer campaigns</li>
            <li>Run social media coverage for a client when Kanye West came to SLC with Sunday Service</li>
            <li>Spoke at Alt Summit, Women's Business Center of Utah, UVU Entrepreneurship Institute, WeLift, & Rising Tide events</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            NOW WHAT:
        </p>
        <p>
            I started teaching in Fall 2022 as an Adjunct Instructor for the Digital Marketing Department at Utah Valley University.

I've also been mentoring as a Dean's Executive in Residence for The Green House, a student run digital marketing agency at UVU.
